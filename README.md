# Eyantra
An initiative by IIT Bombay that aims to create the next generation of embedded systems engineers with a practical outlook to help provide practical solutions to some of the real world problems. e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition for undergraduate students in science and colleges. Selected teams are given a robotic kit complete with accessories and video tutorials to help them learn basic concepts in embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Abstracts of real world problems assigned as "themes" are then implemented by the teams using the robotic kits.

### Task-0:<br>
In this task you will get started by installing the required software. You will install Python, OpenCV and run a test program. 
<br>
### Task-1:<br>
This task will get you familiarized with image processing and path planning techniques. You will learn about processing maze images and automating a process to find solutions for the given maze images. 
<br>
### Task-2: <br>
In this task you will learn about Theta mazes of different sizes and find solutions for these mazes. 

## THEME
After the success of Mangalyaan Mission, India has taken a huge leap in deep space exploration. As you know, humans are utilizing the resources of the planet Earth on an accelerated rate. This has led us to a problem of resource scarcity. One possible solution to mitigate this problem is to search for viable planetary options that can support human life. It is better to start early in this direction of exploration of planets which can sustain human life as our population is increasing rapidly. <br>
We are limited by the technology of our time and the targeted planets might be more than 500 million km away from Earth. It is not possible to send a manned mission to these planets. The only option we are left with is robotic technology. Automated robotic technology will not only obviate risking the lives of human beings but also help in the reduction of overall cost for such exploration. Consider the following scenario: ePlanet-903 has been discovered with promising features for sustaining life. We have already sent a module to the planet serving as the Base Station, docked strategically at the center of a crater. A robot has to navigate its way to the Base Station guided by signals from the Base Station.<br>
e-Yantra has abstracted such a scenario in its “Navigate A Terrain” theme. The Terrain is a crater consisting of five concentric rings. In the middle of the crater in the Base Station is a “Spotter” that provides guidance to the “Rover”, the robot moving through the Terrain. A Map of the Terrain is provided indicating the Checkpoints along the path to the Base Station. Checkpoints ensure accurate tracking of the Spotter by the Rover as it navigates through the concentric rings having openings at random points. The challenge in this theme is to design and program two independent robotic systems that communicate with each other to navigate the spaces between the rings of the arena without missing Checkpoints. <br>
In any space exploration mission, time is a critical factor; the challenge is to navigate the terrain in the shortest time possible and reach the Base Station. The robots that perform the task best in accordance with the rules set for this theme will be declared the WINNER.<br><br>
